      <description>Welcome! My name is Ricardo Beltran and this is my final project for STAT 331 taught at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. In it, I walk you through my analysis of a data set with information on NBA players, games, and metrics. The project also aims to utilize the basics of the blogdown package.
Note that the theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie. Lastly, all analysis was done by Ricardo Beltran</description>
