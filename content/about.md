Welcome! My name is Ricardo Beltran and this is my final project for STAT 331 taught at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. In it, I walk you through my analysis of a data set with information on NBA players, games, and metrics. The project also aims to utilize the basics of the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. 

Note that the theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium). Lastly, all analysis was done by [Ricardo Beltran](https://github.com/RBeltran12358)
